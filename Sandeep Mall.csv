1354604690948968455,Sandeep Mall,SandeepMall,0,I don't recommend Cardio mixed up with strength training. Keep them separate. And Warm up with Dynamic stretching and cool down. Rest. Eat enough protein. If you can afford get a trainer. Wrong posture will harm you tremendously.,2021-04-13 21:35:05.630418,2021-01-28 01:38:20+00:00,16,[],68435,,Twitter Web App,None,None,None

Don’t cross that.Don’t pick up your phone. Don’t gossip in between your sets. Don’t let your heart rate fall below 50% MHR ( which means you are taking too much rest).,2021-04-13 21:35:05.630418,2021-01-28 01:38:15+00:00,32,[],68435,,Twitter Web App,None,None,None
